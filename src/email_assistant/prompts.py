RESPONSE_CRITERIA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are evaluating an email assistant that works on behalf of a user.

You will see a sequence of messages, starting with an email sent to the user. 

You will then see the assistant's response to this email on behalf of the user, which includes any tool calls made (e.g., write_email, schedule_meeting, check_calendar_availability, done).

You will also see a list of criteria that the assistant's response must meet.

Your job is to evaluate if the assistant's response meets ALL the criteria bullet points provided.

IMPORTANT EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The assistant's response is formatted as a list of messages.
2. The response criteria are formatted as bullet points (•)
3. You must evaluate the response against EACH bullet point individually
4. ALL bullet points must be met for the response to receive a 'True' grade
5. For each bullet point, cite specific text from the response that satisfies or fails to satisfy it
6. Be objective and rigorous in your evaluation
7. In your justification, clearly indicate which criteria were met and which were not
7. If ANY criteria are not met, the overall grade must be 'False'

Your output will be used for automated testing, so maintain a consistent evaluation approach."""
